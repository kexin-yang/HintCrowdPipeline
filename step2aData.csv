Since 2x is 2 multiplied by x, you can do an opposite operation to get rid of the 2. Divide 2x/2 and 4/2, dividing both sides of the equation by 2.","So, solve 2x/2 = 4/2, making sure you remember that, if you perform an operation on one side of the equation, you have to also perform the same operation on the other side of the equation.",Dividing 2x/2 cancels out the 2 in the numerator.
