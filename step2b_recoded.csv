This is called ‚Äúcombining like terms",keep the constant on left side and variable on right side. ie -10+1 = -4x + 7x,"equating the both sides , ie -9 = 3x",the answer is x = -3,,2.878,141.044,149.941,10,,,,

Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable. That is, divide both sides by -1.

You have only a variable term on the right: -x. Also, you have only a constant on the left: -1. You can get the variable by itself by dividing both sides by the coefficient of the variable.

When 4 was cancelled out, you did that by subtracting 4 from 4. ","You are going to subtract 4 from the right side of the equal sign.
